## 5. Data Models

### 5.1 List Entity

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "name": "string (required)",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime",
  "tasks": []
}
```

### 5.2 Task Entity

```json
{
  "id": "unique_identifier",
  "title": "string (required)",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "deadline": "datetime (optional)",
  "completed": "boolean (default: false)",
  "priority": "string (low|medium|high, optional)",
  "listId": "string (foreign key)",
  "createdAt": "datetime",
  "updatedAt": "datetime"
}
```

## 6. API Response Standards

### 6.1 Success Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "message": "Operation completed successfully"
}
```

### 6.2 Error Response Format

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable error message",
    "details": "Additional error information"
  }
}
```

## 7. Technical Requirements

### 7.1 Performance

- API response time should be under 500ms for standard operations
- Support for pagination on list and task retrieval endpoints
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### 7.2 Data Validation

- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Proper error handling and meaningful error messages
- Sanitization of user inputs to prevent injection attacks

### 7.3 Date Handling

- All dates should be stored in UTC format
- "Due this week" calculation should consider user's timezone
- Proper date validation for deadline fields
